# Project Euler — Cross-Language Benchmarks

> **Currently: 10 problems × 10 languages = 100 measurements.**
> Growing carefully — each new problem and language is audited for state-leak
> safety, verified for answer correctness, and added only when it cleanly fits the
> measurement methodology.  See [JOURNEY.md](JOURNEY.md) for the full story of how
> we got here, including the reset from 200+ problems back to a verified 10×10 core.

## Per-Invocation Cost (Total, Problems 1–10)

We run each program 10 times in fresh OS processes (no warmup, no shared state).
Each invocation pays full startup + algorithm cost — the cost a real CLI / cron /
shell-loop user actually pays.  The median wall time across the 10 invocations is
the headline per-problem number, and we sum across the 10 problems for the total.

## Method

For each (language, problem):

1. Build the binary (or `as` + `cc` for ARM64, `dotnet build` for C#, etc.).
2. Run the binary 10 times, each in a fresh OS process.  No warmup; no shared state.
3. Each invocation prints `BENCHMARK|problem=NNN|answer=X|time_ns=Y`.  The answer
   is compared against the canonical (each source file's `// Answer:` header
   comment); the benchmark aborts on mismatch.
4. We report the **median** wall time across the 10 invocations.

That's the entire metric.  No "hot" vs "cold" — just per-invocation cost, which
is what every CLI / cron / shell-loop user actually pays.

### What's intentionally not measured

- **In-process warm iterations.**  Server / daemon scenarios are a different
  question — they'd reward language-internal caches (Rust `OnceLock`, primesieve
  internal state, `@lru_cache`, etc.) in ways that don't match the per-invocation
  reality.  See [JOURNEY.md](JOURNEY.md) for the full reasoning behind dropping the
  warm-iter metric.
- **Compile time as a separate column.**  Build cost is part of the user's
  experience for compiled languages, but in our "shell-loop" model the binary is
  already built once.  Build time is observed and recorded for diagnostic use but
  not part of the headline.

### Why the OS process boundary IS the audit tool

Every language has *some* way to cache state for re-use within one process: Rust's
`OnceLock`, C++ libraries' internal lazy-init, Python's `@lru_cache`, Java's static
`final` precomputed tables.  These are *idiomatic, valuable patterns in their
languages*.  We don't want to rule them out — we want each language to look like a
native would write it.

The process boundary makes that work fairly: when each invocation is a fresh OS
process, *every* in-process cache starts empty.  No language gets an unfair
amortization advantage.  No source-code refactoring is required to maintain cross-
language honesty — the OS enforces it for free.

## Sub-Millisecond Floor

On Apple Silicon, process spawn (`fork` + `exec`) costs ~5–10 ms.  Problems where
the algorithm takes < 1 ms (currently p001–p006 in most languages) are effectively
measuring spawn cost, not algorithmic merit.  That **is** what a CLI user pays, so
the number is still meaningful — but the cross-language signal on these problems
mostly reflects runtime startup cost.  The interesting algorithmic signal starts
around p007+.

## Reproducibility

```bash
cd ProjectEuler.Benchmarks
cmd/euler-bench/euler-bench per-iter --lang all --problems 1-10 --iters 10 --write
python3 report.py
```

Sanitization invariant: `data/<lang>.json` files NEVER contain an `answer` field,
regardless of problem number.  Full data including answers lives in `data/private/`
(gitignored), used locally for verification.  See `scripts/sanitization_gate.py`.

## Methodology Story

See [JOURNEY.md](JOURNEY.md) for the full story.  Recent chapters cover:
- The 24-hour cache-strip campaign and its reset (155 source edits reverted)
- The shift from in-process warm iterations to fresh-process per-invocation cost
- The invocation-isolation principle and why the OS is the audit tool
- The data-architecture refactor (single Go writer, no `flock`, no hook chain)
